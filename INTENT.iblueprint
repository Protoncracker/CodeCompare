# § Project Intent: CodeCompare

**Status:** Active Development

**§ Author(s)/Initiator(s):** Protoncracker

**§ Version/Date:** 1.0 / 2025-04-14

## 1. Core Intent / Purpose

* **The Problem/Opportunity/Need:**
    * Developers often need to compare the execution speed of two Python code snippets to make informed optimization decisions. Manual benchmarking is error-prone, inconsistent, and lacks reproducibility.
* **The Vision/Solution:**
    * Provide a command-line tool that enables deterministic, statistically robust, and user-friendly comparison of two Python code snippets, with clear reporting and exportable results.

## 2. Goals / Key Objectives

* Allow users to compare two code snippets or files for execution speed.
* Provide deterministic benchmarking with fixed random seeds.
* Offer statistical analysis (mean, stdev, percentiles, confidence intervals).
* Support custom setup code and warm-up runs.
* Export detailed results and logs (JSON).
* Present results with clear, colored terminal output and progress indication.

## 3. § Success Metrics

* Accurate and repeatable timing results across runs (variance < 5% for stable code).
* Exported logs contain all relevant statistics and raw measurements.
* CLI usability: users can compare code with a single command and minimal setup.
* Handles errors gracefully (invalid code, missing files, etc.).

## 4. Scope

* **Core Focus (In Scope):**
    * Command-line interface for code comparison.
    * Timing and statistical analysis of two Python snippets.
    * Support for custom setup code, warm-up, and progress bar.
    * Output: colored terminal summary, JSON export, verbose logs.
    * Deterministic randomization for fair comparison.
* **§ Explicitly Out of Scope (Non-Goals):**
    * Not a general-purpose benchmarking suite for entire projects.
    * No support for non-Python code.
    * No GUI or web interface.
    * Does not profile memory or CPU usage in detail (only basic system info).

## 5. § Dependencies

* Python 3.7+
* Standard library: argparse, time, statistics, json, etc.
* Optional: psutil (for system load info; gracefully degrades if unavailable)
* No external benchmarking frameworks required.

## 6. § Key Assumptions

* Users have basic familiarity with Python and the command line.
* Code snippets provided are safe to execute and do not require user interaction.
* Timing accuracy is sufficient for micro/millisecond-level comparisons on typical developer hardware.

## 7. § Target Audience / Users / Consumers

* Python developers seeking to compare the performance of alternative code implementations.
* Technical teams needing reproducible microbenchmarks.
* Automated tooling or CI pipelines (via CLI and JSON export).

## 8. § Potential Approach / Technology / Design Notes

* Architecture: Modular Python package with CLI entry point.
* Uses context managers to suppress output and control garbage collection for cleaner timing.
* Progress bar and colored output for usability (can be disabled).
* All results and logs are written to an `outputs/` directory for traceability.
* Designed for extensibility (e.g., future support for more advanced statistical analysis or batch comparisons).
